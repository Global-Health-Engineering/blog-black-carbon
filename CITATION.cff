abstract: >-
  Black carbon in the atmosphere contributes to climate
  change and is a known carcinogen. Yet, this pollutant
  remains largely unmonitored and unregulated. Despite its
  dangers, there are no guidelines on safe levels of black
  carbon in the air we breathe. Itâ€™s time to focus on
  establishing effective regulations to monitor and control
  black carbon concentrations in the atmosphere.
